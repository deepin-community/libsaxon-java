libsaxon-java for debian
-------------------------

I did completly revamped saxon. First Saxon is shipped in a zip form
with compiled classes and jar files. I did unzip the original, removed
the jar files and the javadoc (everything I can build). Then, I unjar
the sources and put them in a 'src' directory. Finally I created an orig
tarball.
